I am an upper-junior majoring in Computer Science and Information Security at CUNY John Jay College of Criminal Justice with a profound interest in cybersecurity and solving real-world issues.

## Objective

My journey as a computer science student has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity. I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
